# Todoist Rules

Drew uses Todoist for task and project management, following GTD (Getting Things Done) principles.

## Labels

### Context Labels
Use these to indicate where/how a task can be done:
- `Anywhere 🌎` - can be done in any location
- `Home 🏠` - requires being at home
- `Office 🏢` - requires being at the office
- `Phone 📱` - can be done via phone
- `Computer 💻` - requires a computer
- `Errands 🛍️` - requires going out / running errands

### Status Labels
- `Waiting` - blocked on someone else / waiting for response
- `Blocked` - blocked by another task or external dependency

## Projects

- **Inbox** - default landing spot for new tasks; needs processing
- **Tasks** - one-off tasks that don't belong to a specific project
- **Routines** - recurring tasks organized by frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually)

## GTD Workflow

1. **Capture** - new tasks go to Inbox
2. **Clarify** - process Inbox regularly; add context labels, due dates, move to appropriate project
3. **Organize** - one-off tasks go to Tasks project; project-specific tasks go to their project
4. **Review** - use context labels to filter tasks based on current situation
5. **Engage** - work from filtered views based on available time and context

## When Adding Tasks

- Add a context label when the task requires a specific location or tool
- Use `Waiting` label when delegated or waiting on external input
- Set due dates only for true deadlines; use labels for context-based work
- Keep task titles actionable (start with a verb)
